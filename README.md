各位Coding大神
* Here I post the contest problems that I feel interesting with my own solutions using c++.
* The problems are chosen from TopCoder, CodeForces, AtCoder, CSAcademy.
* Of course, I have no energy and time post all the questions in those platforms with solutions.
* I only post the questions that I feel interesting and that are not too hard for me to solve by myself.
* I am a noob coder, so please laugh at me if you feel some of the questions are too easy for you.
